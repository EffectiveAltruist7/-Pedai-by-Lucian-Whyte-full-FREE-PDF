    I've decided to make "Pedai," by Lucian Whyte (real name Kirk Shellko) free to the public as a PDF and a .txt file, because I believe it is 
unethical to force students to buy a book that the professor personally wrote. The students are a captive audience who must directly pay the 
professor money by buying their book if they want to pass the class. Trying to make profit for oneself in this manner at their students' expense
is simply immoral.
